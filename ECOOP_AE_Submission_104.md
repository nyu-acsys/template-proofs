ECOOP submission number for the paper: 104

## Metadata to provide during artifact submission in HotCRP

Metadata provided at the HotCRP portal. 

## Quick-start guide (Kick-the-tires phase)

The artifact is available both as Ubuntu 22.04 VM (with GUI) and docker image based on Ubuntu 22.04 (without GUI). The files relevant to the artifact evaluation are contained in the directory `ecoop_artifact` in the Zenodo submission. The location of this directory is `~/ecoop24_artifact` in the VM and `/home/ecoop_artifact` in the docker image.  We provide file locations with respect to this directory. In order to check basic functionality, perform two tasks 
* Navigate to `/templates` and run `xp_ecoop24_short.sh`. The script compiles a small set of files and makes sure that Coq/Iris installation works.
* In case of the VM, run `coqide` in the terminal to test CoqIDE. Step through `/template/flows/gmap_more.v` and `/templates/flows/ccm.v` to make sure CoqIDE runs fine. The docker image does not come with CoqIDE.

## Overview: What does the artifact comprise?

The directory `~/ecoop24_artifact` contains: 

* `/templates` : contains the Coq proof files
* `README.md` : provides details on the files in `/templates`, instructions to evaluate the proofs thoroughly and paper-to-proofs correspondence. 

## For authors claiming an available badge

We agree to publishing the artifact under a Creative Commons license.

## For authors claiming a functional or reusable badge

The data in Table 1 (Sec. 6) can be generated by navigating to `/templates` and running the script `xp_ecoop24.sh`. The line count for the code of the template algorithms is obtained manually from the Coq proof scripts. Hence, the relevant entries are filled with `?` in the generated rows.

Note that the numbers in the paper will differ slightly from the numbers in the artifact due to two reasons : (i) the number of proof lines differ because we worked on the proofs after the paper submission to bring the proofs closer to what was presented in the paper; and (ii) the time numbers will differ because the proofs in the paper were evaluated on Apple M1 Pro chip (as mentioned in the paper).

If the paper is accepted, we will revise the table so as to match with the artifact.

## For authors claiming a reusable badge

The artifact relies on Coq/Iris and CoqIDE in case of VM. The file `README.md` provides instructions on how to set up these tools.

The artifact can be reused in the following scenarios:
* One can modifying the definitions of the hindsight spec and the helping protocol to experiment with alternative approach to encoding hindsight reasoning in Iris.
* One can instatiate hindsight reasoning with a target structure. Files `/templates/hindsight/hindsight.v`, `/templates/lockfree/skiplist.v` and `/templates/multicopy_hindsight/lsm.v` provide a good starting point to follow. Please read `README.md` for better understanding of the `/templates` directory.
